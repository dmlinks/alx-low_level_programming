2.Callaboration is multiplication

3. the number speak for themselves
prints the numbers from 0 to 9

4. i believe in number and signs

Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
Do not print 2 and 4
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

Numbers constitute the only universal language
mandatory
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar three times in your code

6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line
mandatory
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

Prototype: void print_line(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
The line should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe
mandatory
Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
The diagonal should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n
